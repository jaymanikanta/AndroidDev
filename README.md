# Random-Quotes-App
A simple random quotes application made in Android Studio.
## What does it do?
- It fetches random quotes and its respective authors from an array based list and displays them on screen. :v:
- It contains a Floating Action Button whose onClick Listener event is set to a random value of the quotes and authors arrays.
## What did you code it in?
- I used Android Studio and wrote the application in Kotlin. :sunglasses:
